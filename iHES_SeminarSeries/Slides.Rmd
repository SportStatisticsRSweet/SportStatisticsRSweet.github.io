# What is Machine Learning?

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.

# The Analysis & Interaction of Constraints in AFL Matches 

Work by [Peter Browne](https://twitter.com/_PeterBrowne) another PhD graduate of iHES `r emo::ji("tada")`

--

Discrete performance indicators (etc a kick or handball) don't give us the full picture or **context** of the action performed

Modelling constraint interactions and [influence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167945719301939#b0180) on kicking performance, across three performance tiers of Australian Rules competitions

I’d like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, which for me in Richmond, Victoria, are the Wurundjeri-willam people of the Kulin Nation. I also wish to pay my respects to Elders past, present and emerging. Pictured is the beautiful Birrarung.

Victoria University (VU) is ranked in the top 20 globally for sport science education. VU has strong ambitions to be Australia’s leading sport university and a global leader in sport. The VU Sport Strategy, 2019-2023 helps drive to achieve this ambition.

* As you can see on this page, there is a rich history of sport expertise at VU.  
* Over our history and particularly in the last decade, VU has been a leading local, national and global contributor in the field. 
* One of the seven key areas of the sport strategy is to maximise engagement with the sporting industry, through strategic partnerships. 
* One of these partnerships is with the Western Bulldogs Football Club, under which my role is embedded.

* VU's association with the Western Bulldogs began in the 1980's and has now grown to include a multi-faceted partnership with all four AFL, AFLW, VFL and VFLW WB teams. 
* The sport science partnership comprises workplace learning opportunities for students, joint staff appointments and professional development, WB staff and athlete access to VU facilities and expertise. 
* Another major facet of the strategicsport science partnership is collaborative research, including HDR student projects. I work side-by-side with the Bulldogs' coaching, medical and performance teams as part of a structured research program, with the ultimate goal of helping to improve on-field performance.

# Data Sources in Australian Rules Football

???
* Data forms a large part of sport science research. For example, we can capture data on how the athletes are feeling (with respect to soreness and fatigue) before they commence training. Also their strength profiles over the course of a traning phrase or season.
* I'll now take you through what types of data we capture at the WB, as part of this strategic research partnership, to help improve on-field performance.

* Collective team behaviour in invasion sports refers to how individual players position themselves across a field of play to form an overall group organisation
* Determining collective team behaviour may provide a greater understanding of team tactics or game style.
* Jeremy investigated the influence of match phase and field position on collective team behaviour
* Players were more inclined to re-position closer to their defensive end to restrict space when the ball was closer to their goal and conversely, press higher up the field when the ball was in their forward half

# Skilled Involvements

???
* Currently, events and outcomes are captured in statistical analysis of team sports performance. This is frequency count data where a human manually codes performance variables including kicks, tackles and handballs, live during a game or post-hoc via video 
* Kicking is an important action in AF, as it constitutes the predominant form of strategic ball movement and the sole manner in which a goal can be scored.
* On average, each player executes a kick every ten minutes within an AFL match 
* The completion of a successful kick is a resultant of multiple attributes of the game and the immediate constraints that emerge on the kick, such as opposition pressure, team mates’ availability and the current status of the ball carrier
* Accounting for some of these constraints is really important, to give context to the skilled involvements or kicks that occur
* For example, we can look at the source of the kick, so in an AFL context was it from a mark/ free kick or at a stoppage. Was the player on the run whilst kicking or stationary? Did they get rid of the ball in less than two seconds or was it six seconds? How long was the kick? Was the player being tackled whilst they were trying to kick the ball?

I’d like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, which for me in Richmond, Victoria, are the Wurundjeri-willam people of the Kulin Nation. I also wish to pay my respects to Elders past, present and emerging. Pictured is the beautiful Birrarung.

Victoria University (VU) is ranked in the top 20 globally for sport science education. VU has strong ambitions to be Australia’s leading sport university and a global leader in sport. The VU Sport Strategy, 2019-2023 helps drive to achieve this ambition.

* As you can see on this page, there is a rich history of sport expertise at VU.  
* Over our history and particularly in the last decade, VU has been a leading local, national and global contributor in the field. 
* One of the seven key areas of the sport strategy is to maximise engagement with the sporting industry, through strategic partnerships. 
* One of these partnerships is with the Western Bulldogs Football Club, under which my role is embedded.

* VU's association with the Western Bulldogs began in the 1980's and has now grown to include a multi-faceted partnership with all four AFL, AFLW, VFL and VFLW WB teams. 
* The sport science partnership comprises workplace learning opportunities for students, joint staff appointments and professional development, WB staff and athlete access to VU facilities and expertise. 
* Another major facet of the strategicsport science partnership is collaborative research, including HDR student projects. I work side-by-side with the Bulldogs' coaching, medical and performance teams as part of a structured research program, with the ultimate goal of helping to improve on-field performance. 
* My role is embeded under this strategic partnership

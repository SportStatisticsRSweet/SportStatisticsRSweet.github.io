# If You Do Use A Spreadsheet Program for Data Analysis...
]
* Ensure you are consistent
???
* This includes coding categorical data the same (so male and female, not male and m, female and f)
* Use a consistent code for missing data, rather than leaving it blank AND highlighting the cell AND/OR writing NA
* Be careful with extra white spaces, mixing date types and creating easy to interpret row/ column headers
--
<br>
<br>
* Put only one thing in a cell
???
* Put one piece of data in a cell
* Try and use the same units in columns
* Don't merge cells (looks pretty) but really isn't very functional & very messy when exporting
--
<br>
<br>
* Treat raw data as *exactly* that, raw data!
???
* Keep raw data separate, preferably in another document appropriately labelled
* If you do keep raw data in the same workbook, put it in another tab and lock the tab from editing



???
* A single big rectangle with rows corresponding to subjects and columns corresponding to variables.
* The first row should contain variable names, and please do not use more than one row for the variable names.
* Sometimes you need to make different Excel files, to fit tidy data
* Often, people have bits of data sprinkled around, including summary statistics next to their raw data!

???
- Python is widely used by data scientists and engineers around the world. Also a popular introductory language
- Code is fairly straightforward to read and supported by open-source communities, with suggestion encouraged for improvements to the software
- Great at using data dictionaries to drive analysis. For example, creating a data dictionary of skilled actions in Australian Football and looking up skilled actions in an untidy, messy format.
- Python is free, open-source and has fantastic data visualisation capabilities
- You don't have to be a programmer to program in Python 
- However, the error messages can be really annoying to understand, particuarly when dealing with large volumes of code/ data

???
- R, like Python, is free and open-source. 
- Relies on the community to create, push and debug packages that can handle all parts of the data import, tidying, analysing, visualising & reporting process
- Developed with statistics in mind, which it does super well.
- Has a whole host of tools to deal with the data pipeline, called the tidyverse
- Highly flexible software that can run on any operating system
- RStudio has a whole host of features, including GitHub integration and the ability to run Python code inside of R
- Personally, I found R easier to get started in and the community very welcoming to help with debugging. Therefore, I think it is great to use for movement science
- I still use Python for really specific things like above and work with many colleagues who use Python

???
- Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system.
- Accesses many records with one single command and eliminates the need to specify how to reach the record
- Contains many statements, that focus on querying, definitions, data control and manipulation
- These elements include clauses, expressions, predicates, queries and statements
- Insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL
- Used for interacting with a database for extracting data, updating data, replacing data, creating data
- Typically used when you have data hosted in servers, that are large 
- I've used SQL queries on a data.frame, that has been extracted into R. There are a number of different packages that help with this.

* Avoids having multiple .R and .RData files scattered within and across multiple folders!

.center[
# Setting up the R Workspace (cont.)
]


* Create a folder within your new project (either via RStudio or manually) named "Data"


--

* Next, copy the example data (.xlsx) downloaded file into this "Data" folder


--
 

* Ensure the packages below are installed or up-to-date:

```{r InstallPackagesForWorkshop, eval = FALSE}
# Create a list of the packages required
IntroToRPackages <- c(
    'readxl',
    'tidyverse',

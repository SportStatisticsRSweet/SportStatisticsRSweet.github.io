I wish to acknowledge the people of the Kulin Nations, on whose land we are gathered today. I pay my respects to their Elders, past and present.

Pictured is the river Birrarung, near where I live, whose Traditional Owners where I live and usually work, are the Wurundjeri-willam people of the Kulin Nation.

* These parameters can help give insight into specific drills, training as a whole and help to evaluate training sessions
* (Click to show link) we can also use aggregate data to cluster drills based on these physical outputs, into high/ medium/ low intensity categories
* Aggregate parameters don't give granular insights into physical output
* Difficult to determine when output changes over time

* Identify and describe segments of physical output in team-sport matches that are very different.

# How to Classify Kicks in Australian Football?


Work by [Emily Cust, PhD](https://twitter.com/EmCust) who used inertial measurement units (IMUs) to classify Australian Rules football (AF) kick types in an applied environment using ankle-mounted IMUs.

???
IMUs and video capture of a controlled protocol, including four kick types at varying distances, were recorded during a single testing session with 20 female AF athletes. Processed IMU data were modelled using support vector machine classifier, random forest, and k-nearest neighbour algorithms under a 2-Kick, 4-Kick, and kick distance (10, 20, 30 m) conditions. The random forest model showed the highest results for overall classification accuracy, highlighting the potential for an applied semi-automated AF training kick detection and type classification system using IMUs. 
- Anyone who has had to film and manually notate how many kicks, or skilled actions, an athlete performs during a training session will know just laborious this task is! Hence the ability to use wearable sensors and machine learning approaches to help classify kick counts is super useful, turning around analysis quicker and freeing up the time of the performance analyst to focus on interpreting the data for evaluating the training session.

# Interaction of Skilled Behaviours Australian Football?

Work by [Peter Browne, PhD](https://twitter.com/_PeterBrowne) who explored the interaction of skilled constraints using rule-mining techniques

]

???
* I spoke on the previous slide about classifying kicks in Australian Football and counting these. Currently, events and outcomes are captured in statistical analysis of team sports performance. This is frequency count data where a human manually codes performance variables including kicks, tackles and handballs, live during a game or post-hoc via video 
* Kicking is an important action in AF, as it constitutes the predominant form of strategic ball movement and the sole manner in which a goal can be scored.
* On average, each player executes a kick every ten minutes within an AFL match 
* The completion of a successful kick is a resultant of multiple attributes of the game and the immediate constraints that emerge on the kick, such as opposition pressure, team mates’ availability and the current status of the ball carrier
- Determining the influential constraints within competitive performance, with respect to their impact on key performance outcomes, would provide an evidence-based approach to practice designs, harnessing the power of performance analysis and evaluations
* For example, we can look at the source of the kick, so in an AFL context was it from a mark/ free kick or at a stoppage. Was the player on the run whilst kicking or stationary? Did they get rid of the ball in less than two seconds or was it six seconds? How long was the kick? Was the player being tackled whilst they were trying to kick the ball?
* These constraints can also interact with one another, in non-linear manner
* Here is work from Peter Browne's PhD thesis, where he measured the context or constraints surrounding skilled involvements during Aussie Rules football.
* So if we take a kick, as an example, we can assess the influence that these different constraints have together, on the likelihood of an effective kick. We can do this through rule mining techniques, which is very common in a marketing space but also now widely used in sports analytics.
*  Example of how adding additional constraint variables and considering the constraint interaction alters the mean efficiency of the kick outcome. 
* Percentage values indicate confidence level of an effective kick. We can see as constraints accumulate, the average kicking efficiency is altered

# How Do Athletes and Teams Coordinate During Matches?

]

???
* From the same data source, of capturing an athlete's position over time relative to a court or field and team-mates/ opposition is to examine tactical behaviours or collective team behavior
* Collective team behaviour in invasion sports refers to how individual players position themselves across a field of play to form an overall group organisation. Determining collective team behaviour may provide a greater understanding of team tactics or game style.
* Here we have an Aussie Rules football ground, with the blue dots representing the position of an athlete. We can measure the centroid, or the middle position of all the dots/ athletes and the maximum length and width of the team. This gives us an idea as to how teams spread and congest around the ball, during phases of play so in attack or defense or transitioning the ball from attack to defence.
* This is work from Jeremy Alexander's PhD thesis, with the WB, investigated the influence of match phase and field position on collective team behaviour
* Players were more inclined to re-position closer to their defensive end to restrict space when the ball was closer to their goal and conversely, press higher up the field when the ball was in their forward half
